# About 

The main objective of this project was to crawl news and information websites and then anticipate the probability of them getting popular.

**_To fit our data into this model, we will have to calculate all the above mentioned attributes related to our data. Detail of those calculations is discussed in the code._**

# What is Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA)

For the calulation of attributes like "LDA_00", "LDA_01", "LDA_02", "LDA_03", "LDA_04", we will have to make a LDA model. In natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. LDA is an example of a topic model and belongs to the machine learning toolbox and in wider sense to the artificial intelligence toolbox. The LDA algorithm is applied in order to first identify the five top relevant topics and then measures the closeness of each articles to such topics.

# What are non-neutral tokens

Non-neutral tokens are those tokens which are more likely to exhibit the following POS Tags: Nouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Interjections.
In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context—i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.
